    <h2>How to Make Butternut Squash Risotto</h2>

This is a quick and easy recipe to make a delicious steak and chips.
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
 <li>2 ribeye or sirloin steaks</li>
  <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cut into chips</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (for steak)</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
  <li>Fresh thyme or rosemary (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
   <li>Peel and cut the potatoes into thick chips, then soak them in cold water for 30 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
  <li>Drain and dry the chips, then fry them in hot vegetable oil (about 160째C / 320째F) for 4-5 minutes until soft but not golden. Remove and set aside.</li>
  <li>Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper. Heat a pan with olive oil over high heat and sear the steaks for 2-3 minutes per side for medium-rare, adjusting time for desired doneness.</li>
  <li>In the last minute of cooking, add butter, crushed garlic, and fresh herbs to the pan, basting the steaks with the melted butter for extra flavor.</li>
  <li>Rest the steaks for 5 minutes while you increase the oil temperature to 190째C (375째F) and fry the chips again for 2-3 minutes until golden and crispy.</li>
  <li>Serve the steaks with the crispy chips and your choice of sauce or side salad.</li>
</ol>
