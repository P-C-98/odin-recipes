    <h2>How to Make Butternut Squash Risotto</h2>

This butternut squash risotto takes a little time to prepare, but the process is simple. Heres how it goes:

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
  <li>1 small butternut squash, peeled and diced into small cubes</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
  <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
  <li>300g arborio rice</li>
  <li>1 liter vegetable or chicken stock (keep warm)</li>
  <li>100ml dry white wine (optional)</li>
  <li>50g Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper</li>
  <li>Fresh sage or parsley (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F). Toss butternut squash cubes in olive oil, season with salt and pepper, then roast for 20-25 minutes until tender and caramelized.</li>
